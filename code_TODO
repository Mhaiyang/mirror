0: Nearest-neighbor

2: Bi-quadratic
3: Bi-cubic
4: Bi-quartic
5: Bi-quintic

2(ok).change resize_image mode.(square to pad64?)

3.Apply all anchor scales on each feature level.

4. Try path augmentation of PANet. (model.py --> class msak rcnn --> build.)

5. Use Bicubic interpolation to resize the mask predicted by neural network to original size.
(order = 1 to 3)

# Network
1.top-down is UpSampling2D (inverse pooling), use Transconv to substitute it
